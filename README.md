A C/C++ Graphics Engine written with OpenGL and GLFW. Our goal for the project is to be able to manipulate 3d models within a GUI to create a scene and then create a "final render" in the form of an output image using ray tracing algorithms. This can be used to render CAD models of designs and other 3d files. 

## Setup

### Requirements

* Bash
* GLFW
* OpenGL

### Building

To build the engine locally run the command from the project directory:  
```
./bin/local-make.sh
```

To run unit tests locally run the command from the project directory:  

```
./bin/local-make.sh tests
```

Usage:

```
./bin/local-make.sh [tests] 
```

### Progress .. trippy!
The cow is multi-colored because we just assigned random color values to each face leading to this super cool trippy effect.
